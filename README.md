# <b>Machine Learning: An Investigation into Vehicle CO2 Emissions</b>

In this project, I investigate the recorded CO2 emissions (WLTP) of 6756 vehicles, and use supervised machine learning techniques to predict CO2 emissions from vehicle features, including the type of powertrain and size of the engine.

The data was obtained via the following UK government link:  
https://carfueldata.vehicle-certification-agency.gov.uk/downloads/default.aspx  
Note that the data at this link is subject to change. The raw data as I obtained it can be found in the data/raw directory [here](data/raw/Euro_6_latest.csv).

In the [Project Report file](ProjectReport.md), I offer a report of the work performed in this project, describing the fundamental stages and key results.
