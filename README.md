# Machine Learning: An Investigation into Vehicle CO2 Emissions

In this project, I investigate the recorded CO2 emissions (WLTP) of 6756 vehicles, and use supervised machine learning to predict CO2 emissions from features such as the type of powertrain and size of the engine.

The data was obtained from the following:
https://carfueldata.vehicle-certification-agency.gov.uk/downloads/default.aspx
Note that the data at this link is subject to change. The raw data as I obtained it can be found in the data/raw directory [here](data/Euro_6_latest.csv).

I use Python and MySQL to perform cleansing, statistical analysis, and visualisation of UK government vehicle emissions data. I train XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression models on the preprocessed data, and compare the performances of each model. I then produce several XGBoost models with hyperparameters tuned using Grid Search, Random Search, HYPEROPT, and Trieste, and compare the results and tuning speeds of each method. Finally, I review two of the models by investigating their accuracies, error distributions, feature importances, and their input requirements.

# <b>Machine Learning: An Investigation into Vehicle CO2 Emissions</b>

In this project, I investigate the recorded CO2 emissions (WLTP) of 6756 vehicles, and use supervised machine learning techniques to predict CO2 emissions from vehicle features, including the type of powertrain and size of the engine.

The data was obtained via the following UK government link:  
https://carfueldata.vehicle-certification-agency.gov.uk/downloads/default.aspx  
Note that the data at this link is subject to change. The raw data as I obtained it can be found in the data/raw directory [here](data/Euro_6_latest.csv).

In the [Project Report file](ProjectReport.md), I offer a report of the work performed in this project, describing the fundamental stages and key results.
